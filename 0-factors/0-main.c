 * 
 * Description:
 * Usage: factors <file>
 *  where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
 *  One number per line
 *  You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1
 *  You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space before
 *  and after the valid number
 *  The file will always end with a new line
 *  Output format: n=p*q
 *   one factorization per line
 *   p and q donâ€™t have to be prime numbers
 * 
 * Return: Nothing
